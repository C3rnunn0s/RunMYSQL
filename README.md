Create SQL Database and run 10 queries assignment from my CS 450 class

Specs
----------

In the database that you created in Assignment 4, formulate and execute each of the following queries in SQL. In each case, you should attempt to handle the task in a single (possibly nested) SQL statement, without using views or SQL subqueries in the FROM clause. 


1. File named build.sql should contain the complete script with which you constructed your database (i.e., all CREATE and all INSERT statements).

2. File named dump.sql should contain a script for a complete listing of your database (similar to Assignment 4).

3. File named dump.txt should contain the output of the execution of the script dump.sql 4. File named queries.sql should contain the SQL statements for each of the 10 problems
of this homework.

5. File named queries.txt should contain the output of the execution of the script
queries.sql.

### Run these queries

1. The students (university ids and names) who are enrolled in CS 450 and have satisfied all its prerequisites.

2. The department (department name) that has the highest number of enrollments in its courses.

3. The departments (department names) that offer more than 3 sections.

4. The courses (department names and course numbers) currently offered and the total number of students enrolled in each (note that a course might have multiple sections, that should be combined).

5. The undergraduate students (university ids and names) who are “part time” (are en- rolled in less than 12 credit hours).

6. The chairpersons (names and department names) who teach.
 
7. The students (university ids, names, and majors) that took, or are currently taking, courses outside their major department. In each case, list also the course (department code, course number, and course title).

8. The ’CS’ designated courses (department codes, course numbers and titles) at 400 level that require as prerequisites all the ’CS’ designated courses at 300 level.

9. The students (university ids and names) who are currently enrolled in a section of a course that they have already taken before.

10. The students (university ids) and the courses (department codes and course numbers), where the student is enrolled in a section of that course, but does not have the prerequisites.
